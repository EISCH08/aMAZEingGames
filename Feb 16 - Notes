First group meeting held in the engineering center lobby.
Members present: Adam, Vladimir, Justin, and Chelsea (Parker was at work and was emailed a meeting summary afterwards).
What we discussed/accomplished:
  - agreed to make our project a website instead of an app.
  - the website is going to be something that allows users to play non-challenging, entertaining games.
  - set up a communication channel on 'discord', which we will use with different channels to progress project.
  - completed our project one milestone 
  
No second meeting is scheduled yet but once we get everyone's schedule figured out we should have a consistent plan to meet in person 
at least once per week for the remainder of the semester.
