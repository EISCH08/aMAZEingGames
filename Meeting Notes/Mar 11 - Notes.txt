Group Meeting 3
Members present: Chelsea, Vlad, Parker, Sol

This week, we discussed what we had worked on in the past week. We've gotten a start on the layout of the website, created a basic user authentication and creation system, and created a basic snake game.

Although there are improvements that are needed to be made, we have a few goals in mind for this week:
- Determine exactly what will be presented to the TA for milestone 3 later this week.
- Integrate the login system with the current website design
- Combine the user registration and user create systems into one file/location.
- Possibly look into changing authentication from using PHP to Node.js
- Add the snake game to the website
